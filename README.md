# Datapath Logistics – End-to-End Supply Chain Analysis

## Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of Datapath Logistics company supply chain operations.  
By processing a large dataset of **180,000 rows and 50 variables**, I built a complete data pipeline that transforms raw operational data into actionable business insights.

The main objectives were to:
- Identify shipping bottlenecks  
- Analyze profitability across product categories  
- Understand customer behavior and loyalty patterns
